Calibration results (with uncertainties):

Focal Length:          fc = [ 6877.04842   6880.77162 ] ± [ 20.71404   21.05643 ]
Principal point:       cc = [ 2570.08674   1803.69633 ] ± [ 23.03477   15.74517 ]
Skew:             alpha_c = [ 0.00000 ] ± [ 0.00000  ]   => angle of pixel axes = 90.00000 ± 0.00000 degrees
Distortion:            kc = [ -0.17656   0.23937   0.00007   0.00084  0.00000 ] ± [ 0.01860   0.22106   0.00057   0.00071  0.00000 ]
Pixel error:          err = [ 0.99330   1.04708 ]

Note: The numerical errors are approximately three times the standard deviations (for reference).
