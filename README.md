## Assignment Description:
Image stitching is a technique to combine a set of images into a larger image by registering, warping, resampling and blending them together. A popular application of image stitching is to create panoramas. Generally speaking, there are two classes of methods for image stitching: direct methods and feature-based methods. In this project we implement a feature-based method using SIFT features.

## Features:
This is a brief description of our implementation. More details can be found in the other pages of the wiki.

### Basic Features:
* Warping to cylindrical coordinates
* Alignment computation using SIFT features and RANSAC
* Stitching and cropping with feather blending
* Interactive viewer page

### "Bonus" Features:
* Warping, alignment, stitching, and cropping using homographies
* Exposure correction
* Pyramid blending
* Image to doc straightening
